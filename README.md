This is the supplementary information package of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering paper titled "The EmpathiSEr: Development and Validation of Software Engineering Oriented Empathy Scales" authored by Hashini Gunatilake, John Grundy, Rashina Hoda, and Ingo Mueller.

In this study, we developed and validated two domain-specific empathy scales: EmpathiSEr-P, assessing empathy among practitioners, and EmpathiSEr-U, capturing practitioner empathy towards users. The scale development followed a rigorous, multi-phase methodology that integrated established psychological measures with empirical insights from the SE domain. The items were refined through expert evaluation, cognitive interviews, and statistical analysis, resulting in two psychometrically sound instruments that capture cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions of empathy.
